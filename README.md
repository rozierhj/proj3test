    There is also a page header where the user is given a menu option to login to their account or to signup for an account.
    After logging in or signing up the user is taken back to the search page where they can continue searching for books. They now have the option to save a book to their favorites.
    In the header menu for the user when they are signed in there is the option to go to their saved book list. Once they are on their saved books page they have the option to remove any books they want. Just like the search results, each book card displays an image for the book, the title, author(s), description and a link to the book online. The header menu also gives the user the option to go back to the search page to search for more books as well as the option to log out.
